The PBPK model vancomycin was developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data covering intravenous administration with a dose range of 500-1000mg, including single dose (SD) as well as multiple dose (MD) clinical data. 

During the model-fitting, the following parameter was estimated (all other parameters were fixed to reported values):

* Lipophilicity

The fit resulted in an adequate description of all data. As only limited amount of data was available, and the description of the data was adequate, an additional inclusion of hepatic clearance did not further improve the description of the data as proposed in other published PBPK models, and is therefore not included in the model. Further data were not available to further evaluate the model performance.

The model results show that the PBPK model of vancomycin adequately described the data for intravenous administration for single and multiple dose.
