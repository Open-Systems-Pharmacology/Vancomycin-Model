### 2.2.1 In vitro / physicochemical data

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of vancomycin. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below, and is used for model building.

| **Parameter**      | **Unit**  | **Literature value (reference)**                             | **Description**                                 |

| pKa                |           | Acid 2.18, Base 7.75, Base 8.89 ([Radke 2017](#5-references)) | Acid/base dissociation constant                 |
| Solubility (pH)    | mg/L      | 225 (7) ([Drugbank.ca](#5-references))                       | Solubility                                      |
| logP               |           | -4.41 ([Zhou 2016](#5-references)), 1.11 ([Drugbank.ca](#5-references)), 2.45 ([Radke 2017](#5-references)) | Partition coefficient between octanol and water |
| fu                 |           | 0.48 ([Zhou 2016](#5-references)), 0.67 ([Radke 2017](#5-references)) | Fraction unbound                                |
| GFR fraction       | ÂµM        | 1 ([Zhou 2016](#5-references))                               | fraction of Glomerular filtration rate          |
| Hepatic clearance* | mL/min/kg | 0.11 ([Radke 2017](#5-references))                           | Hepatic clearance                               |
| Renal clearance*   | mL/min/kg | 0.95 ([Radke 2017](#5-references))                           | Renal clearance                                 |

*Both Hepatic and Renal clearance reported by others have not been used in the final model.

### 2.2.2 Clinical data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on vancomycin in adults. 

The following publications were found in adults for model building and evaluation:

| Publication                       | Study description                                            |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Boeckh 1988](#5-references) | Pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity of vancomycin alone and in combination with ceftazidime in healthy volunteers |
| [Healy 1987](#5-references) | Comparison of steady-state pharmacokinetics of two dosage regimens of vancomycin in normal volunteers |
